# 🩺 HealthSync — AI-Powered Health Insights from Apple Health + Azure OpenAI

**HealthSync** is a privacy-first iOS app that transforms your Apple Health data into personalized health advice using Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Whether you're curious about your recent activity, heart trends, or weight changes, the app gives you intelligent, friendly feedback—no backend, no database, just you and your data.

## 💡 What It Does

You can ask things like:
> "How active was I last month?"  
> "Is my recent weight trend okay?"  
> "How can I gradually improve my heart health?"  

And get a response generated by GPT-4o, grounded in **your real HealthKit data**.

- No login
- No database
- No cloud storage

Just local health data → securely sent to Azure OpenAI → response shown to you in-app.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 📲 Frontend
- Built with **SwiftUI**
- Integrates directly with **HealthKit**
- Markdown rendering for GPT replies
- Built-in **terms & disclaimer page**

### 🧠 AI Backend
- Uses **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)** via Azure AI Foundry
- Prompts are structured to simulate a **friendly doctor & fitness coach**
- No custom server or middleware required

### 🔒 Privacy by Design
- Health data is only read from HealthKit
- Sent securely to Azure OpenAI via HTTPS
- Not stored anywhere — not locally, not remotely

## 🩺 Health Data Used

The app reads and summarizes up to **18 months** of the following:

- Body Mass (Weight)
- Step Count
- Active Energy Burned
- Heart Rate
- Resting Heart Rate
- Walking Heart Rate
- VO₂ Max
- Flights Climbed
- Distance (Walking/Running)

Future updates may include sleep, blood pressure, and hydration tracking.

## 🛠 Prompt Engineering Example

```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
  "messages": [
    [
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a compassionate, professional health assistant..."
    ],
    ["role": "user", "content": userPrompt]
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7
]
````

> The model avoids technical language like "JSON input" to keep the UX clean and human.

## 🧪 Sample Question

> **User:** What’s my step trend over the past few months?
> **GPT-4o:** You've averaged around 6,400 steps per day, with a slight dip in June. Try walking 500 extra steps daily to gradually increase your baseline activity.
